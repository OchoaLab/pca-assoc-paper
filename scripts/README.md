## PCA association project code

The pipeline for reproducing our results is described in the `main.bash` file.

However, the evaluations are very computationally intensive, particularly the ones involving the real datasets, which cannot be run on a desktop in a reasonable amount of time.
We used computer clusters to perform most of the plink2 and GCTA association runs.
