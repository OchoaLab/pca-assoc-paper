                   association studies, which arises principally because
                   of population structure and cryptic relatedness. Many
                   treatments of the problem consider only a simple
                   “island” model of population structure. We take a
                   broader approach, which views population structure
                   and cryptic relatedness as different aspects of a
                   single confounder: the unobserved pedigree defining
                   the (often distant) relationships among the study
                   subjects. Kinship is therefore a central concept, and
                   we review methods of defining and estimating kinship
                   coefficients, both pedigree-based and marker-based.
                   In this unified framework we review solutions to the
                   problem of population structure, including
                   family-based study designs, genomic control,
                   structured association, regression control, principal
                   components adjustment and linear mixed models. The
                   last solution makes the most explicit use of the
                   kinships among the study subjects, and has an
                   established role in the analysis of animal and plant
                   breeding studies. Recent computational developments
                   mean that analyses of human genetic association data
                   are beginning to benefit from its powerful tests for
                   association, which protect against population
                   structure and cryptic kinship, as well as
                   intermediate levels of confounding by the pedigree.},

                   polymorphisms (SNP) covering the genome and an
                   efficient method to assess SNP genotypes are expected
                   to be available in the near future. An outstanding
                   question is how to use these technologies efficiently
                   to identify genes affecting liability to complex
                   disorders. To achieve this goal, we propose a
                   statistical method that has several optimal
                   properties: It can be used with case-control data and
                   yet, like family-based designs, controls for
                   population heterogeneity; it is insensitive to the
                   usual violations of model assumptions, such as cases
                   failing to be strictly independent; and, by using
                   Bayesian outlier methods, it circumvents the need for
                   Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, leading to
                   better performance in many settings while still
                   constraining risk for false positives. The
                   performance of our genomic control method is quite
                   good for plausible effects of liability genes, which
                   bodes well for future genetic analyses of complex

  abstract =      {Case-control association studies are widely used in
                   the search for genetic variants that contribute to
                   human diseases. It has long been known that such
                   studies may suffer from high rates of false positives
                   if there is unrecognized population structure. It is
                   perhaps less widely appreciated that so-called
                   “cryptic relatedness” (i.e., kinship among the
                   cases or controls that is not known to the
                   investigator) might also potentially inflate the
                   false positive rate. Until now there has been little
                   work to assess how serious this problem is likely to
                   be in practice. In this paper, we develop a formal
                   model of cryptic relatedness, and study its impact on
                   association studies. We provide simple expressions
                   that predict the extent of confounding due to cryptic
                   relatedness. Surprisingly, these expressions are
                   functions of directly observable parameters. Our
                   analytical results show that, for well-designed
                   studies in outbred populations, the degree of
                   confounding due to cryptic relatedness will usually
                   be negligible. However, in contrast, studies where
                   there is a sampling bias toward collecting relatives
                   may indeed suffer from excessive rates of false
                   positives. Furthermore, cryptic relatedness may be a
                   serious concern in founder populations that have
                   grown rapidly and recently from a small size. As an
                   example, we analyze the impact of excess relatedness
                   among cases for six phenotypes measured in the
                   Hutterite population.},

                   individuals may be subject to bias caused by
                   population stratification, alternative methods that
                   are robust to population stratification such as
                   family-based association designs may be less
                   powerful. Recently, various statistical methods
                   robust to population stratification were proposed for
                   association studies, using unrelated individuals to
                   identify associations between candidate markers and
                   traits of interest (both qualitative and
                   quantitative). Here, we propose a semiparametric test
                   for association (SPTA). SPTA controls for population
                   stratification through a set of genomic markers by
                   first deriving a genetic background variable for each
                   sampled individual through his/her genotypes at a
                   series of independent markers, and then modeling the
                   relationship between trait values, genotypic scores
                   at the candidate marker, and genetic background
                   variables through a semiparametric model. We assume
                   that the exact form of relationship between the trait
                   value and the genetic background variable is unknown
                   and estimated through smoothing techniques. We
                   evaluate the performance of SPTA through simulations
                   both with discrete subpopulation models and with
                   continuous admixture population models. The
                   simulation results suggest that our procedure has a
                   correct type I error rate in the presence of
                   population stratification and is more powerful than
                   statistical association tests for family-based
                   association designs in all the cases considered.
                   Moreover, SPTA is more powerful than the Quantitative
                   Similarity-Based Association Test (QSAT) developed by
                   us under continuous admixture populations, and the
                   number of independent markers needed by SPTA to
                   control for population stratification is
                   substantially fewer than that required by QSAT. Genet

                   Their results have, however, been questioned, in part
                   because of the bias induced by population
                   stratification. This is a consequence of systematic
                   differences in allele frequencies due to the
                   difference in sample ancestries that can lead to both
                   false positive or false negative findings. Many
                   strategies are available to account for
                   stratification but their performances differ, for
                   instance according to the type of population
                   structure, the disease susceptibility locus minor
                   allele frequency, the degree of sampling imbalanced,
                   or the sample size. We focus on the type of
                   population structure and propose a comparison of the
                   most commonly used methods to deal with
                   stratification that are the Genomic Control,
                   Principal Component based methods such as implemented
                   in Eigenstrat, adjusted Regressions and Meta-Analyses
                   strategies. Our assessment of the methods is based on
                   a large simulation study, involving several scenarios
                   corresponding to many types of population structures.
                   We focused on both false positive rate and power to
                   determine which methods perform the best. Our
                   analysis showed that if there is no population
                   structure, none of the tests led to a bias nor
                   decreased the power except for the Meta-Analyses.
                   When the population is stratified, adjusted Logistic
                   Regressions and Eigenstrat are the best solutions to
                   account for stratification even though only the
                   Logistic Regressions are able to constantly maintain
                   correct false positive rates. This study provides
                   more details about these methods. Their advantages

                   common complex disorders. A serious problem with
                   association mapping is that population structure can
                   lead to spurious associations between a candidate
                   marker and a phenotype. One common solution has been
                   to abandon case-control studies in favor of
                   family-based tests of association, such as the
                   transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT), but this
                   comes at a considerable cost in the need to collect
                   DNA from close relatives of affected individuals. In
                   this article we describe a novel, statistically
                   valid, method for case-control association studies in
                   structured populations. Our method uses a set of
                   unlinked genetic markers to infer details of
                   population structure, and to estimate the ancestry of
                   sampled individuals, before using this information to
                   test for associations within subpopulations. It
                   provides power comparable with the TDT in many
                   settings and may substantially outperform it if there
                   are conflicting associations in different
                   subpopulations.},

  abstract =      {Population stratification has long been recognized as
                   a confounding factor in genetic association studies.
                   Estimated ancestries, derived from multi-locus
                   genotype data, can be used to perform a statistical
                   correction for population stratification. One popular
                   technique for estimation of ancestry is the
                   model-based approach embodied by the widely applied
                   program structure. Another approach, implemented in
                   the program EIGENSTRAT, relies on Principal Component
                   Analysis rather than model-based estimation and does
                   not directly deliver admixture fractions. EIGENSTRAT
                   has gained in popularity in part owing to its
                   remarkable speed in comparison to structure. We
                   present a new algorithm and a program, ADMIXTURE, for
                   model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated
                   individuals. ADMIXTURE adopts the likelihood model
                   embedded in structure. However, ADMIXTURE runs
                   considerably faster, solving problems in minutes that
                   take structure hours. In many of our experiments, we
                   have found that ADMIXTURE is almost as fast as
                   EIGENSTRAT. The runtime improvements of ADMIXTURE
                   rely on a fast block relaxation scheme using
                   sequential quadratic programming for block updates,
                   coupled with a novel quasi-Newton acceleration of
                   convergence. Our algorithm also runs faster and with
                   greater accuracy than the implementation of an
                   Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm incorporated
                   in the program FRAPPE. Our simulations show that
                   ADMIXTURE's maximum likelihood estimates of the
                   underlying admixture coefficients and ancestral
                   allele frequencies are as accurate as structure's
                   Bayesian estimates. On real-world data sets,
                   ADMIXTURE's estimates are directly comparable to
                   those from structure and EIGENSTRAT. Taken together,
                   our results show that ADMIXTURE's computational speed
                   opens up the possibility of using a much larger set
                   of markers in model-based ancestry estimation and
                   that its estimates are suitable for use in correcting
                   for population stratification in association

                   discovered that at the MHC region Mexicans have
                   excessive African ancestral alleles compared to the
                   rest of the genome, which is the hallmark of recent
                   selection for admixed samples. The estimated
                   selection coefficients are 0.05 and 0.07 for two
                   datasets, which put our finding among the strongest
                   known selections observed in humans, namely, lactase
                   selection in northern Europeans and sickle-cell trait
                   in Africans. Using inaccurate Amerindian training
                   samples was a major concern for the credibility of
                   previously reported selection signals in Latinos.
                   Taking advantage of the flexibility of our
                   statistical model, we devised a model fitting
                   technique that can learn Amerindian ancestral
                   haplotype from the admixed samples, which allows us
                   to infer local ancestries for Mexicans using only
                   European and African training samples. The strong
                   selection signal at the MHC remains without
                   Amerindian training samples. Finally, we note that
                   medical history studies suggest such a strong
                   selection at MHC is plausible in Mexicans.},

                   variation across geographical location and ethnic

                   to inform about historical demographic processes,
                   little is known about the relationship between
                   fundamental demographic parameters and the projection

                   for SNP data the projection of samples onto the
                   principal components can be obtained directly from
                   considering the average coalescent times between

                   perpendicular gradients in geographic space. The

                   geneticists to understand fundamental demographic
                   parameters. Here, we provide an interpretation of PCA
                   based on relatedness measures, which are described by
                   the probability that sets of genes are
                   identical-by-descent (IBD). An approximately linear
                   transformation between ancestral proportions (AP) of
                   individuals with multiple ancestries and their
                   projections onto the principal components is found.
                   In addition, a new method of eigenanalysis "EIGMIX"
                   is proposed to estimate individual ancestries. EIGMIX
                   is a method of moments with computational efficiency
                   suitable for millions of SNP data, and it is not
                   subject to the assumption of linkage equilibrium.
                   With the assumptions of multiple ancestries and their
                   surrogate ancestral samples, EIGMIX is able to infer
                   ancestral proportions (APs) of individuals. The
                   methods were applied to the SNP data from the HapMap
                   Phase 3 project and the Human Genome Diversity Panel.
                   The APs of individuals inferred by EIGMIX are
                   consistent with the findings of the program
                   ADMIXTURE. In conclusion, EIGMIX can be used to
                   detect population structure and estimate genome-wide
                   ancestral proportions with a relatively high
                   accuracy.},

                   population structure, called ALStructure The strategy
                   of ALStructure is to first estimate the
                   low-dimensional linear subspace of the population
                   admixture components, and then search for a model
                   within this subspace that is consistent with the
                   admixture model's natural probabilistic constraints.
                   Central to this strategy is the observation that all
                   models belonging to this constrained space of
                   solutions are risk-minimizing and have equal
                   likelihood, rendering any additional optimization
                   unnecessary. The low-dimensional linear subspace is
                   estimated through a recently introduced principal
                   components analysis method that is appropriate for
                   genotype data, thereby providing a solution that has
                   both principal components and probabilistic admixture
                   interpretations. Our approach differs fundamentally
                   from other existing methods for estimating admixture,
                   which aim to fit the admixture model directly by
                   searching for parameters that maximize the likelihood
                   function or the posterior probability. We observe
                   that ALStructure typically outperforms existing
                   methods both in accuracy and computational speed
                   under a wide array of simulated and real human
                   genotype datasets. Throughout this work, we emphasize
                   that the admixture model is a special case of a much
                   broader class of models for which algorithms similar
                   to ALStructure may be successfully employed.},

                   mapping is the fact that marker-trait associations
                   may arise from confounding population structure as
                   well as from linkage to causative polymorphisms.
                   Using genome-wide marker data, we have previously
                   demonstrated that the problem can be severe in a
                   global sample of 95 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions,
                   and that established methods for controlling for
                   population structure are generally insufficient.
                   Here, we use the same sample together with a number
                   of flowering-related phenotypes and data-perturbation
                   simulations to evaluate a wider range of methods for
                   controlling for population structure. We find that,
                   in terms of reducing the false-positive rate while
                   maintaining statistical power, a recently introduced
                   mixed-model approach that takes genome-wide
                   differences in relatedness into account via estimated
                   pairwise kinship coefficients generally performs
                   best. By combining the association results with
                   results from linkage mapping in F2 crosses, we
                   identify one previously known true positive and
                   several promising new associations, but also
                   demonstrate the existence of both false positives and
                   false negatives. Our results illustrate the potential
                   of genome-wide association scans as a tool for
                   dissecting the genetics of natural variation, while
                   at the same time highlighting the pitfalls. The
                   importance of study design is clear; our study is
                   severely under-powered both in terms of sample size
                   and marker density. Our results also provide a
                   striking demonstration of confounding by population
                   structure. While statistical methods can be used to
                   ameliorate this problem, they cannot always be
                   effective and are certainly not a substitute for
                   independent evidence, such as that obtained via
                   crosses or transgenic experiments. Ultimately,
                   association mapping is a powerful tool for
                   identifying a list of candidates that is short enough
                   to permit further genetic study.},

  abstract =      {A novel haplotype association method is presented,
                   and its power is demonstrated. Relying on a
                   statistical model for linkage disequilibrium (LD),
                   the method first infers ancestral haplotypes and
                   their loadings at each marker for each individual.
                   The loadings are then used to quantify local
                   haplotype sharing between individuals at each marker.
                   A statistical model was developed to link the local
                   haplotype sharing and phenotypes to test for
                   association. We devised a novel method to fit the LD
                   model, reducing the complexity from putatively
                   quadratic to linear (in the number of ancestral
                   haplotypes). Therefore, the LD model can be fitted to
                   all study samples simultaneously, and, consequently,
                   our method is applicable to big data sets. Compared
                   to existing haplotype association methods, our method
                   integrated out phase uncertainty, avoided
                   arbitrariness in specifying haplotypes, and had the
                   same number of tests as the single-SNP analysis. We
                   applied our method to data from the Wellcome Trust
                   Case Control Consortium and discovered eight novel
                   associations between seven gene regions and five
                   disease phenotypes. Among these, GRIK4, which encodes
                   a protein that belongs to the glutamate-gated ionic
                   channel family, is strongly associated with both
                   coronary artery disease and rheumatoid arthritis. A

                   population-based cohort study across the United
                   Kingdom. It provides unprecedented opportunities for
                   researchers to investigate the relationship between
                   genotypic information and phenotypes of interest.
                   Multiple regression methods, compared with
                   genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have already
                   been showed to greatly improve the prediction
                   performance for a variety of phenotypes. In the
                   high-dimensional settings, the lasso, since its first
                   proposal in statistics, has been proved to be an
                   effective method for simultaneous variable selection
                   and estimation. However, the large-scale and
                   ultrahigh dimension seen in the UK Biobank pose new
                   challenges for applying the lasso method, as many
                   existing algorithms and their implementations are not
                   scalable to large applications. In this paper, we
                   propose a computational framework called batch
                   screening iterative lasso (BASIL) that can take
                   advantage of any existing lasso solver and easily
                   build a scalable solution for very large data,
                   including those that are larger than the memory size.
                   We introduce snpnet, an R package that implements the
                   proposed algorithm on top of glmnet and optimizes for
                   single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets. It
                   currently supports ℓ1-penalized linear model,
                   logistic regression, Cox model, and also extends to
                   the elastic net with ℓ1/ℓ2 penalty. We
                   demonstrate results on the UK Biobank dataset, where
                   we achieve competitive predictive performance for all
                   four phenotypes considered (height, body mass index,
                   asthma, high cholesterol) using only a small fraction
                   of the variants compared with other established
                   polygenic risk score methods.},

                   conducted to identify genetic variants that influence
                   complex disorders. It is well known that failure to
                   properly account for population or pedigree structure
                   can lead to spurious association as well as reduced
                   power. We propose a method, ROADTRIPS, for
                   case-control association testing in samples with
                   partially or completely unknown population and
                   pedigree structure. ROADTRIPS uses a covariance
                   matrix estimated from genome-screen data to correct
                   for unknown population and pedigree structure while
                   maintaining high power by taking advantage of known
                   pedigree information when it is available. ROADTRIPS
                   can incorporate data on arbitrary combinations of
                   related and unrelated individuals and is
                   computationally feasible for the analysis of genetic
                   studies with millions of markers. In simulations with
                   related individuals and population structure,
                   including admixture, we demonstrate that ROADTRIPS
                   provides a substantial improvement over existing
                   methods in terms of power and type 1 error. The
                   ROADTRIPS method can be used across a variety of
                   study designs, ranging from studies that have a
                   combination of unrelated individuals and small
                   pedigrees to studies of isolated founder populations
                   with partially known or completely unknown pedigrees.
                   We apply the method to analyze two data sets: a study
                   of rheumatoid arthritis in small UK pedigrees, from
                   Genetic Analysis Workshop 15, and data from the
                   Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism on
                   alcohol dependence in a sample of moderate-size
                   pedigrees of European descent, from Genetic Analysis
                   Workshop 14. We detect genome-wide significant

                   population structure within a sample to correct for
                   confounding due to ancestry. GWAS implementation of
                   PCA uses tens of thousands of single-nucleotide
                   polymorphisms (SNPs) to infer structure, despite the
                   fact that only a small fraction of such SNPs provides
                   useful information on ancestry. The identification of
                   this reduced set of Ancestry-Informative markers
                   (AIMs) from a GWAS has practical value; for example,
                   researchers can genotype the AIM set to correct for
                   potential confounding due to ancestry in follow-up
                   studies that utilize custom SNP or sequencing
                   technology. We propose a novel technique to identify
                   AIMs from Genome-Wide SNP data using sparse PCA. The
                   procedure uses penalized regression methods to
                   identify those SNPs in a Genome-Wide panel that
                   significantly contribute to the principal components
                   while encouraging SNPs that provide negligible
                   loadings to vanish from the analysis. We found that
                   sparse PCA leads to negligible loss of ancestry
                   information compared to traditional PCA analysis of
                   Genome-Wide SNP data. We further demonstrate the
                   value of sparse PCA for AIM selection using real data
                   from the International HapMap Project and a
                   Genome-Wide study of inflammatory bowel disease. We

                   established approach for identifying signals of
                   natural selection. However, existing methods
                   generally require discrete subpopulations. We
                   introduce a method that infers selection using
                   principal components (PCs) by identifying variants
                   whose differentiation along top PCs is significantly
                   greater than the null distribution of genetic drift.
                   To enable the application of this method to large
                   datasets, we developed the FastPCA software, which
                   employs recent advances in random matrix theory to
                   accurately approximate top PCs while reducing time
                   and memory cost from quadratic to linear in the
                   number of individuals, a computational improvement of
                   many orders of magnitude. We apply FastPCA to a
                   cohort of 54,734 European Americans, identifying 5
                   distinct subpopulations spanning the top 4 PCs. Using
                   the PC-based test for natural selection, we replicate
                   previously known selected loci and identify three new
                   genome-wide significant signals of selection,
                   including selection in Europeans at ADH1B. The coding
                   variant rs1229984∗T has previously been associated
                   to a decreased risk of alcoholism and shown to be
                   under selection in East Asians; we show that it is a
                   rare example of independent evolution on two
                   continents. We also detect selection signals at
                   IGFBP3 and IGH, which have also previously been

                   Association mapping, however, holds great promise if
                   true signals of functional association can be
                   separated from the vast number of false signals

                   multiple levels of relatedness simultaneously as
                   detected by random genetic markers. We applied this
                   new approach to two samples: a family-based sample of
                   14 human families, for quantitative gene expression

                   population structure, for quantitative trait

                   between family-based and structured association
                   samples, it provides a powerful complement to

                   such as inbred mouse strains is a promising approach
                   for the identification of risk factors related to
                   human diseases. However, genetic association studies
                   in inbred model organisms are confronted by the
                   problem of complex population structure among
                   strains. This induces inflated false positive rates,
                   which cannot be corrected using standard approaches
                   applied in human association studies such as genomic
                   control or structured association. Recent studies
                   demonstrated that mixed models successfully correct
                   for the genetic relatedness in association mapping in
                   maize and Arabidopsis panel data sets. However, the
                   currently available mixed-model methods suffer from
                   computational inefficiency. In this article, we
                   propose a new method, efficient mixed-model
                   association (EMMA), which corrects for population
                   structure and genetic relatedness in model organism
                   association mapping. Our method takes advantage of
                   the specific nature of the optimization problem in
                   applying mixed models for association mapping, which
                   allows us to substantially increase the computational
                   speed and reliability of the results. We applied EMMA
                   to in silico whole-genome association mapping of
                   inbred mouse strains involving hundreds of thousands
                   of SNPs, in addition to Arabidopsis and maize data
                   sets. We also performed extensive simulation studies
                   to estimate the statistical power of EMMA under
                   various SNP effects, varying degrees of population
                   structure, and differing numbers of multiple
                   measurements per strain. Despite the limited power of
                   inbred mouse association mapping due to the limited
                   number of available inbred strains, we are able to
                   identify significantly associated SNPs, which fall
                   into known QTL or genes identified through previous
                   studies while avoiding an inflation of false
                   positives. An R package implementation and webserver
                   of our EMMA method are publicly available.},

                   quantitatively characterize structure and
                   relatedness. Kinship matrices have also become a
                   fundamental quantity used in genome-wide association
                   studies and heritability estimation. The most
                   frequently-used estimators of FST and kinship are
                   method-of-moments estimators whose accuracies depend
                   strongly on the existence of simple underlying forms
                   of structure, such as the independent subpopulations
                   model of non-overlapping, independently evolving
                   subpopulations. However, modern data sets have
                   revealed that these simple models of structure likely
                   do not hold in many populations, including humans. In
                   this work, we analyze the behavior of these
                   estimators in the presence of arbitrarily-complex
                   population structures, which results in an improved
                   estimation framework specifically designed for
                   arbitrary population structures. After generalizing
                   the definition of FST to arbitrary population
                   structures and establishing a framework for assessing
                   bias and consistency of genome-wide estimators, we
                   calculate the accuracy of existing FST and kinship
                   estimators under arbitrary population structures,
                   characterizing biases and estimation challenges
                   unobserved under their originally-assumed models of
                   structure. We then present our new approach, which
                   consistently estimates kinship and FST when the
                   minimum kinship value in the dataset is estimated
                   consistently. We illustrate our results using
                   simulated genotypes from an admixture model,
                   constructing a one-dimensional geographic scenario
                   that departs nontrivially from the independent
                   subpopulations model. Our simulations reveal the
                   potential for severe biases in estimates of existing
                   approaches that are overcome by our new framework.
                   This work may significantly improve future analyses
                   that rely on accurate kinship and FST estimates.},

                   Failure to properly account for population structure
                   can lead to spurious association or reduced power. In
                   this article, we compare the performance of six
                   methods correcting for population stratification in
                   case–control association studies. These methods
                   include genomic control (GC), EIGENSTRAT, principal
                   component-based logistic regression (PCA-L),
                   LAPSTRUCT, ROADTRIPS, and EMMAX. We also include the
                   uncorrected Armitage test for comparison. In the
                   simulation studies, we consider a wide range of
                   population structure models for unrelated samples,
                   including admixture. Our simulation results suggest
                   that PCA-L and LAPSTRUCT perform well over all the
                   scenarios studied, whereas GC, ROADTRIPS, and EMMAX
                   fail to correct for population structure at single
                   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that show strong
                   differentiation across ancestral populations. The
                   Armitage test does not adjust for confounding due to
                   stratification thus has inflated type I error. Among
                   all correction methods, EMMAX has the greatest power,

                   binary traits have substantially fewer cases than
                   controls. Both of the widely used approaches, the
                   linear mixed model and the recently proposed logistic
                   mixed model, perform poorly; they produce large type
                   I error rates when used to analyze unbalanced

                   that uses the saddlepoint approximation to calibrate
                   the distribution of score test statistics. This
                   method, SAIGE (Scalable and Accurate Implementation

                   values even when case-control ratios are extremely
                   unbalanced. SAIGE uses state-of-art optimization
                   strategies to reduce computational costs; hence, it
                   is applicable to GWAS for thousands of phenotypes by
                   large biobanks. Through the analysis of UK Biobank

                   association analysis, a range of methods utilizing
                   within-family variation such as
                   transmission-disequilibrium test (TDT)-based methods
                   have been developed. In scenarios where
                   stratification is not a concern, methods exploiting
                   between-family variation in addition to within-family
                   variation, such as the measured genotype (MG)
                   approach, have greater power. Application of MG
                   methods can be computationally demanding (especially
                   for large pedigrees), making genomewide scans
                   practically infeasible. Here we suggest a novel
                   approach for genomewide pedigree-based quantitative
                   trait loci (QTL) association analysis: genomewide
                   rapid association using mixed model and regression
                   (GRAMMAR). The method first obtains residuals
                   adjusted for family effects and subsequently analyzes
                   the association between these residuals and genetic
                   polymorphisms using rapid least-squares methods. At
                   the final step, the selected polymorphisms may be
                   followed up with the full measured genotype (MG)
                   analysis. In a simulation study, we compared type 1
                   error, power, and operational characteristics of the
                   proposed method with those of MG and TDT-based
                   approaches. For moderately heritable (30\%) traits in
                   human pedigrees the power of the GRAMMAR and the MG
                   approaches is similar and is much higher than that of
                   TDT-based approaches. When using tabulated
                   thresholds, the proposed method is less powerful than
                   MG for very high heritabilities and pedigrees
                   including large sibships like those observed in
                   livestock pedigrees. However, there is little or no
                   difference in empirical power of MG and the proposed
                   method. In any scenario, GRAMMAR is much faster than
                   MG and enables rapid analysis of hundreds of
                   thousands of markers.},

                   Here we report a user-friendly software tool called
                   genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), which was
                   developed based on a method we recently developed to
                   address the "missing heritability" problem. GCTA
                   estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a
                   chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait
                   rather than testing the association of any particular
                   SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main
                   functions: data management, estimation of the genetic
                   relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis
                   of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the
                   linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS
                   simulation. We focus on the function of estimating
                   the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X
                   chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage
                   compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool

                   cost O(MN(2)) (where N is the number of samples and M
                   is the number of SNPs) and implicitly assume an

                   confounding factors in genome-wide association
                   studies (GWAS). It has been standard practice to
                   include principal components of the genotypes in a
                   regression model in order to account for population
                   structure. More recently, the linear mixed model
                   (LMM) has emerged as a powerful method for
                   simultaneously accounting for population structure
                   and kinship. The statistical theory underlying the
                   differences in empirical performance between modeling
                   principal components as fixed versus random effects
                   has not been thoroughly examined. We undertake an
                   analysis to formalize the relationship between these
                   widely used methods and elucidate the statistical
                   properties of each. Moreover, we introduce a new
                   statistic, effective degrees of freedom, that serves
                   as a metric of model complexity and a novel low rank
                   linear mixed model (LRLMM) to learn the
                   dimensionality of the correction for population
                   structure and kinship, and we assess its performance
                   through simulations. A comparison of the results of
                   LRLMM and a standard LMM analysis applied to GWAS
                   data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis
                   (MESA) illustrates how our theoretical results
                   translate into empirical properties of the mixed
                   model. Finally, the analysis demonstrates the ability
                   of the LRLMM to substantially boost the strength of
                   an association for HDL cholesterol in Europeans.},

                   and phenotypes may be confounded by unrecognized
                   population structure and/or admixture. Studies have
                   shown that even in European populations, which are
                   thought to be relatively homogeneous, population
                   stratification exists and can affect the validity of
                   association studies. A number of methods have been
                   proposed to address this issue in recent years. Among
                   them, the mixed-model based approach and the
                   principal component-based approach have several
                   advantages over other methods. However, these
                   approaches have not been thoroughly evaluated on
                   large human datasets. The objectives of this study
                   are to (1) evaluate and compare the performance of
                   the mixed-model approach and the principal
                   component-based approach for genetic association
                   mapping using human data consisting of unrelated
                   individuals, and (2) understand the relationship
                   between these two approaches. To achieve these goals,
                   we simulate datasets based on the HapMap data under
                   various scenarios. Our results indicate that the
                   mixed-model approach performs well in controlling for
                   population structure/admixture. It has similar
                   performance as that based on principal component
                   analysis. However, the approach combining mixed-model
                   and principal component analysis does not perform as
                   well as either method itself.},

                   limitations. To control false positives, population
                   structure and kinship are incorporated in a fixed and
                   random effect Mixed Linear Model (MLM). However,
                   because of the confounding between population
                   structure, kinship, and quantitative trait
                   nucleotides (QTNs), MLM leads to false negatives,
                   missing some potentially important discoveries. Here,
                   we present a new method, Fixed and random model
                   Circulating Probability Unification (FarmCPU).
                   FarmCPU performs marker tests with associated markers
                   as covariates in a fixed effect model and
                   optimization on the associated covariate markers in a
                   random effect model separately. This process enables
                   efficient computation, removes the confounding,
                   prevents model over-fitting, and controls false
                   positives simultaneously. FarmCPU controls false
                   positives as well as MLM with reductions in both

                   Over the past 10 years, new approaches using mixed

                   effects of population structure and relatedness in

                   as a foundation for investigating the relationship
                   between genotype and phenotype. Here we present
                   results of the pilot phase of the project, designed
                   to develop and compare different strategies for
                   genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput
                   platforms. We undertook three projects: low-coverage
                   whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from four
                   populations; high-coverage sequencing of two
                   mother–father–child trios; and exon-targeted
                   sequencing of 697 individuals from seven populations.
                   We describe the location, allele frequency and local
                   haplotype structure of approximately 15 million
                   single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short
                   insertions and deletions, and 20,000 structural
                   variants, most of which were previously undescribed.
                   We show that, because we have catalogued the vast
                   majority of common variation, over 95\% of the
                   currently accessible variants found in any individual
                   are present in this data set. On average, each person
                   is found to carry approximately 250 to 300
                   loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50
                   to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited
                   disorders. We demonstrate how these results can be
                   used to inform association and functional studies.
                   From the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of
                   de novo germline base substitution mutations to be
                   approximately 10−8 per base pair per generation. We
                   explore the data with regard to signatures of natural
                   selection, and identify a marked reduction of genetic
                   variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to
                   selection at linked sites. These methods and public

  abstract =      {By characterizing the geographic and functional
                   spectrum of human genetic variation, the 1000 Genomes
                   Project aims to build a resource to help to
                   understand the genetic contribution to disease. Here
                   we describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals from 14
                   populations, constructed using a combination of
                   low-coverage whole-genome and exome sequencing. By
                   developing methods to integrate information across
                   several algorithms and diverse data sources, we
                   provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million
                   single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4 million short
                   insertions and deletions, and more than 14,000 larger
                   deletions. We show that individuals from different
                   populations carry different profiles of rare and
                   common variants, and that low-frequency variants show
                   substantial geographic differentiation, which is
                   further increased by the action of purifying
                   selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and
                   coding consequence are key determinants of the
                   strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant
                   load varies substantially across biological pathways,
                   and that each individual contains hundreds of rare
                   non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as
                   motif-disrupting changes in
                   transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource,
                   which captures up to 98\% of accessible single
                   nucleotide polymorphisms at a frequency of 1\% in
                   related populations, enables analysis of common and
                   low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse,
                   including admixed, populations.},

                   differences among individuals account for 93 to 95\%
                   of genetic variation; differences among major groups
                   constitute only 3 to 5\%. Nevertheless, without using
                   prior information about the origins of individuals,
                   we identified six main genetic clusters, five of
                   which correspond to major geographic regions, and
                   subclusters that often correspond to individual
                   populations. General agreement of genetic and

                   biology. We present a suite of methods for learning
                   about population mixtures, implemented in a software
                   package called ADMIXTOOLS, that support formal tests
                   for whether mixture occurred and make it possible to
                   infer proportions and dates of mixture. We also
                   describe the development of a new single nucleotide
                   polymorphism (SNP) array consisting of 629,433 sites
                   with clearly documented ascertainment that was
                   specifically designed for population genetic analyses
                   and that we genotyped in 934 individuals from 53
                   diverse populations. To illustrate the methods, we
                   give a number of examples that provide new insights
                   about the history of human admixture. The most
                   striking finding is a clear signal of admixture into
                   northern Europe, with one ancestral population

                   other related to present-day populations of northeast

                   of admixture between Neolithic migrants and the
                   indigenous Mesolithic population of Europe,

                   Easterners; and early European farmers, who were
                   mainly of Near Eastern origin but also harboured west
                   European hunter-gatherer related ancestry. We model

                   {\textasciitilde}12,000 and 1,400 bc, from Natufian
                   hunter-gatherers to Bronze Age farmers. We show that
                   the earliest populations of the Near East derived
                   around half their ancestry from a 'Basal Eurasian'
                   lineage that had little if any Neanderthal admixture
                   and that separated from other non-African lineages
                   before their separation from each other. The first
                   farmers of the southern Levant (Israel and Jordan)
                   and Zagros Mountains (Iran) were strongly genetically
                   differentiated, and each descended from local
                   hunter-gatherers. By the time of the Bronze Age,
                   these two populations and Anatolian-related farmers
                   had mixed with each other and with the
                   hunter-gatherers of Europe to greatly reduce genetic
                   differentiation. The impact of the Near Eastern
                   farmers extended beyond the Near East: farmers
                   related to those of Anatolia spread westward into
                   Europe; farmers related to those of the Levant spread
                   southward into East Africa; farmers related to those
                   of Iran spread northward into the Eurasian steppe;
                   and people related to both the early farmers of Iran
                   and to the pastoralists of the Eurasian steppe spread
                   eastward into South Asia.},

                   culture in the South Pacific around 3,000 years ago
                   marked the beginning of the last major human
                   dispersal to unpopulated lands. However, the
                   relationship of these pioneers to the
                   long-established Papuan people of the New Guinea
                   region is unclear. Here we present genome-wide
                   ancient DNA data from three individuals from Vanuatu
                   (about 3,100-2,700 years before present) and one from
                   Tonga (about 2,700-2,300 years before present), and
                   analyse them with data from 778 present-day East
                   Asians and Oceanians. Today, indigenous people of the
                   South Pacific harbour a mixture of ancestry from
                   Papuans and a population of East Asian origin that no
                   longer exists in unmixed form, but is a match to the
                   ancient individuals. Most analyses have interpreted
                   the minimum of twenty-five per cent Papuan ancestry
                   in the region today as evidence that the first humans
                   to reach Remote Oceania, including Polynesia, were
                   derived from population mixtures near New Guinea,
                   before their further expansion into Remote Oceania.
                   However, our finding that the ancient individuals had
                   little to no Papuan ancestry implies that later human
                   population movements spread Papuan ancestry through
                   the South Pacific after the first peopling of the
                   islands.},

                   population genetic models for complex traits. In this
                   report, we investigate distributions of various
                   population genetic parameters and their
                   interrelationships using estimates of allele
                   frequencies and effect-size parameters for about 400
                   susceptibility SNPs across a spectrum of qualitative
                   and quantitative traits. We calibrate our analysis by
                   statistical power for detection of SNPs to account
                   for overrepresentation of variants with larger effect
                   sizes in currently known SNPs that are expected due
                   to statistical power for discovery. Across all
                   qualitative disease traits, minor alleles conferred
                   “risk” more often than “protection.” Across
                   all traits, an inverse relationship existed between
                   “regression effects” and allele frequencies. Both
                   of these trends were remarkably strong for type I
                   diabetes, a trait that is most likely to be
                   influenced by selection, but were modest for other
                   traits such as human height or late-onset diseases
                   such as type II diabetes and cancers. Across all
                   traits, the estimated effect-size distribution
                   suggested the existence of increasingly large numbers
                   of susceptibility SNPs with decreasingly small
                   effects. For most traits, the set of SNPs with
                   intermediate minor allele frequencies (5–20\%)
                   contained an unusually small number of susceptibility
                   loci and explained a relatively small fraction of
                   heritability compared with what would be expected
                   from the distribution of SNPs in the general
                   population. These trends could have several
                   implications for future studies of common and
                   uncommon variants.},

  abstract =      {Human genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are
                   revealing the genetic architecture of anthropomorphic
                   and biomedical traits, i.e., the frequencies and
                   effect sizes of variants that contribute to heritable
                   variation in a trait. To interpret these findings, we
                   need to understand how genetic architecture is shaped
                   by basic population genetics processes—notably, by
                   mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift.
                   Because many quantitative traits are subject to
                   stabilizing selection and because genetic variation
                   that affects one trait often affects many others, we
                   model the genetic architecture of a focal trait that
                   arises under stabilizing selection in a
                   multidimensional trait space. We solve the model for
                   the phenotypic distribution and allelic dynamics at
                   steady state and derive robust, closed-form solutions
                   for summary statistics of the genetic architecture.
                   Our results provide a simple interpretation for
                   missing heritability and why it varies among traits.
                   They predict that the distribution of variances
                   contributed by loci identified in GWASs is well
                   approximated by a simple functional form that depends
                   on a single parameter: the expected contribution to
                   genetic variance of a strongly selected site
                   affecting the trait. We test this prediction against
                   the results of GWASs for height and body mass index
                   (BMI) and find that it fits the data well, allowing
                   us to make inferences about the degree of pleiotropy
                   and mutational target size for these traits. Our
                   findings help to explain why the GWAS for height
                   explains more of the heritable variance than the
                   similarly sized GWAS for BMI and to predict the
                   increase in explained heritability with study sample
                   size. Considering the demographic history of European
                   populations, in which these GWASs were performed, we
                   further find that most of the associations they
                   identified likely involve mutations that arose
                   shortly before or during the Out-of-Africa bottleneck
                   at sites with selection coefficients around s =

                   relatedness and the overall population structure,

                   However, existing estimators are only accurate under
                   restrictive conditions that most natural population
                   structures do not satisfy. We recently derived new
                   kinship and FST estimators for arbitrary population
                   structures [1, 2]. Our estimates on human datasets
                   reveal a complex population structure driven by
                   founder effects due to dispersal from Africa and
                   admixture. Notably, our new approach estimates larger
                   FST values of 26\% for native worldwide human
                   populations and 23\% for admixed Hispanic
                   individuals, whereas the existing approach estimates
                   9.8\% and 2.6\%, respectively. While previous work
                   correctly measured FST between subpopulation pairs,
                   our generalized FST measures genetic distances among
                   all individuals and their most recent common ancestor
                   (MRCA) population, revealing that genetic
                   differentiation is greater than previously
                   appreciated. This analysis demonstrates that
                   estimating kinship and FST under more realistic
                   assumptions is important for modern population

  abstract =      {A method is proposed for allowing for the effects of
                   population differentiation, and other factors, in
                   forensic inference based on DNA profiles. Much
                   current forensic practice ignores, for example, the
                   effects of coancestry and inappropriate databases and
                   is consequently systematically biased against
                   defendants. Problems with the 'product rule' for
                   forensic identification have been highlighted by
                   several authors, but important aspects of the
                   problems are not widely appreciated. This arises in
                   part because the match probability has often been
                   confused with the relative frequency of the profile.
                   Further, the analogous problems in paternity cases
                   have received little attention. The proposed method
                   is derived under general assumptions about the
                   underlying population genetic processes.
                   Probabilities relevant to forensic inference are
                   expressed in terms of a single parameter whose values
                   can be chosen to reflect the specific circumstances.
                   The method is currently used in some UK courts and
                   has important advantages over the 'Ceiling Principle'
                   method, which has been criticized on a number of
                   grounds.},

                   the R package ape has continuously grown its
                   contents, and has been used by a growing community of
                   users. The release of version 5.0 has marked a leap
                   towards a modern software for evolutionary analyses.
                   Efforts have been put to improve efficiency,
                   flexibility, support for 'big data' (R's long
                   vectors), ease of use and quality check before a new
                   release. These changes will hopefully make ape a
                   useful software for the study of biodiversity and
                   evolution in a context of increasing data quantity.

                   hypothesis testing error measure is the false
                   discovery rate (FDR), which is loosely defined to be
                   the expected proportion of false positives among all
                   significant hypotheses. The FDR is especially
                   appropriate for exploratory analyses in which one is
                   interested in finding several significant results
                   among many tests. In this work, we introduce a
                   modified version of the FDR called the "positive
                   false discoveryrate" (pFDR). We discuss the
                   advantages and disadvantages of the pFDR and

                   sequencing of multiple genomes, the analysis of large
                   data sets has become commonplace in biology. It is
                   often the case that thousands of features in a
                   genomewide data set are tested against some null
                   hypothesis, where a number of features are expected
                   to be significant. Here we propose an approach to
                   measuring statistical significance in these
                   genomewide studies based on the concept of the false
                   discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible
                   balance between the number of true and false
                   positives that is automatically calibrated and easily
                   interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical
                   significance called the value is associated with each
                   tested feature. The value is similar to the well
                   known value, except it is a measure of significance
                   in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the
                   false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of
                   false positive results, while offering a more liberal
                   criterion than what has been used in genome scans for

                   quantitatively understand variation of genetic
                   polymorphisms among individuals. The aggregated
                   number of genotyped humans is currently on the order
                   of millions of individuals, and existing methods do
                   not scale to data of this size. To solve this
                   problem, we developed TeraStructure, an algorithm to
                   fit Bayesian models of genetic variation in
                   structured human populations on tera-sample-sized
                   data sets (1012 observed genotypes; for example, 1
                   million individuals at 1 million SNPs). TeraStructure
                   is a scalable approach to Bayesian inference in which
                   subsamples of markers are used to update an estimate

  abstract =      {Motivation: Exploring the genetic basis of heritable
                   traits remains one of the central challenges in
                   biomedical research. In traits with simple Mendelian
                   architectures, single polymorphic loci explain a
                   significant fraction of the phenotypic variability.
                   However, many traits of interest seem to be subject
                   to multifactorial control by groups of genetic loci.
                   Accurate detection of such multivariate associations
                   is non-trivial and often compromised by limited
                   statistical power. At the same time, confounding
                   influences, such as population structure, cause
                   spurious association signals that result in
                   false-positive findings.Results: We propose linear
                   mixed models LMM-Lasso, a mixed model that allows for
                   both multi-locus mapping and correction for
                   confounding effects. Our approach is simple and free
                   of tuning parameters; it effectively controls for
                   population structure and scales to genome-wide
                   datasets. LMM-Lasso simultaneously discovers likely
                   causal variants and allows for multi-marker–based
                   phenotype prediction from genotype. We demonstrate
                   the practical use of LMM-Lasso in genome-wide
                   association studies in Arabidopsis thaliana and
                   linkage mapping in mouse, where our method achieves
                   significantly more accurate phenotype prediction for
                   91\% of the considered phenotypes. At the same time,
                   our model dissects the phenotypic variability into
                   components that result from individual single
                   nucleotide polymorphism effects and population
                   structure. Enrichment of known candidate genes
                   suggests that the individual associations retrieved
                   by LMM-Lasso are likely to be genuine.Availability:

  abstract =      {Genealogical inference from genetic data is essential
                   for a variety of applications in human genetics. In
                   genome-wide and sequencing association studies, for
                   example, accurate inference on both recent genetic
                   relatedness, such as family structure, and more
                   distant genetic relatedness, such as population
                   structure, is necessary for protection against
                   spurious associations. Distinguishing familial
                   relatedness from population structure with genotype
                   data, however, is difficult because both manifest as
                   genetic similarity through the sharing of alleles.
                   Existing approaches for inference on recent genetic
                   relatedness have limitations in the presence of
                   population structure, where they either (1) make
                   strong and simplifying assumptions about population
                   structure, which are often untenable, or (2) require
                   correct specification of and appropriate reference
                   population panels for the ancestries in the sample,
                   which might be unknown or not well defined. Here, we
                   propose PC-Relate, a model-free approach for
                   estimating commonly used measures of recent genetic
                   relatedness, such as kinship coefficients and IBD
                   sharing probabilities, in the presence of unspecified
                   structure. PC-Relate uses principal components
                   calculated from genome-screen data to partition
                   genetic correlations among sampled individuals due to
                   the sharing of recent ancestors and more distant
                   common ancestry into two separate components, without
                   requiring specification of the ancestral populations
                   or reference population panels. In simulation studies
                   with population structure, including admixture, we
                   demonstrate that PC-Relate provides accurate
                   estimates of genetic relatedness and improved
                   relationship classification over widely used
                   approaches. We further demonstrate the utility of
                   PC-Relate in applications to three ancestrally
                   diverse samples that vary in both size and
                   genealogical complexity.},

                   whole genome sequencing data for studies of human
                   population genetics and human diseases. The last
                   release of this project includes more than 2,500
                   sequenced individuals from 26 populations. Although
                   relationships among individuals have been
                   investigated in some of the populations, inbreeding
                   has never been studied. In this article, we estimated
                   the genomic inbreeding coefficient of each individual
                   and found an unexpected high level of inbreeding in
                   1000 Genomes data: nearly a quarter of the
                   individuals were inbred and around 4\% of them had
                   inbreeding coefficients similar or greater than the
                   ones expected for first-cousin offspring. Inbred
                   individuals were found in each of the 26 populations,
                   with some populations showing proportions of inbred
                   individuals above 50\%. We also detected 227
                   previously unreported pairs of close relatives (up to
                   and including first-cousins). Thus, we propose
                   subsets of unrelated and outbred individuals, for use
                   by the scientific community. In addition, because
                   admixed populations are present in the 1000 Genomes
                   Project, we performed simulations to study the
                   robustness of inbreeding coefficient estimates in the
                   presence of admixture. We found that our multi-point
                   approach (FSuite) was quite robust to admixture,
                   unlike single-point methods (PLINK).},

                   variants between 96,464 human pairs has been
                   calculated. The distributions of these differences
                   for individuals within European, Asian, or African
                   origin were characterized by narrow unimodal peaks
                   with mean values of 3.8, 3.5, and 5.1 million,
                   respectively, and standard deviations of 0.1–0.03
                   million. The total numbers of genomic differences
                   between pairs of all known relatives were found to be
                   significantly lower than their respective population
                   means and in reverse proportion to the distance of
                   their consanguinity. By counting the total number of
                   genomic differences it is possible to infer familial
                   relations for people that share down to 6\% of common
                   loci identical-by-descent. Detection of familial
                   relations can be radically improved when only very
                   rare genetic variants are taken into account.
                   Counting of total number of shared very rare single
                   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from whole-genome
                   sequences allows establishing distant familial
                   relations for persons with eighth and ninth degrees
                   of relationship. Using this analysis we predicted 271
                   distant familial pairwise relations among 1,092
                   individuals that have not been declared by 1000
                   Genomes Project. Particularly, among 89 British and
                   97 Chinese individuals we found three
                   British–Chinese pairs with distant genetic
                   relationships. Individuals from these pairs share
                   identical-by-descent DNA fragments that represent
                   0.001\%, 0.004\%, and 0.01\% of their genomes. With
                   affordable whole-genome sequencing techniques, very
                   rare SNPs should become important genetic markers for

                   identical-by-descent (IBD) chromosomal segments
                   between sequenced genomes is presented. It utilizes
                   the distribution patterns of very rare genetic
                   variants (vrGVs), which have minor allele frequencies
                   \&lt;0.2\%. Contrary to the existing probabilistic
                   approaches our method is rather deterministic,
                   because it considers a group of very rare events
                   which cannot happen together only by chance. This
                   method has been applied for exhaustive computational
                   search of shared IBD segments among 1,092 sequenced
                   individuals from 14 populations. It demonstrated that
                   clusters of vrGVs are unique and powerful markers of
                   genetic relatedness, that uncover IBD chromosomal
                   segments between and within populations, irrespective
                   of whether divergence was recent or occurred
                   hundreds-to-thousands of years ago. We found that
                   several IBD segments are shared by practically any
                   possible pair of individuals belonging to the same
                   population. Moreover, shared short IBD segments
                   (median size 183 kb) were found in 10\% of
                   inter-continental human pairs, each comprising of a
                   person from sub-Saharan Africa and a person from
                   Southern Europe. The shortest shared IBD segments
                   (median size 54 kb) were found in 0.42\% of
                   inter-continental pairs composed of individuals from
                   Chinese/Japanese populations and Africans from Kenya
                   and Nigeria. Knowledge of inheritance of IBD segments
                   is important in clinical case–control and cohort
                   studies, since unknown distant familial relationships
                   could compromise interpretation of collected data.
                   Clusters of vrGVs should be useful markers for
                   familial relationship and common multifactorial

	abstract = {Common genetic association models for structured populations, including Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}) and Linear Mixed-effects Models ({LMM}), model the correlation structure between individuals using population kinship matrices, also known as Genetic Relatedness Matrices or "{GRMs}". However, the most common kinship estimators can have severe biases that were only recently determined. Here we characterize the effect of these kinship biases on genetic association. We employ a large simulated admixed family and genotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project, both with simulated traits, to evaluate key kinship estimators. Remarkably, we find practically invariant association statistics for kinship matrices of different bias types (matching all other features). We then prove using statistical theory and linear algebra that {LMM} association tests are invariant to these kinship biases, and {PCA} approximately so. Our proof shows that the intercept and relatedness effect coefficients compensate for the kinship bias, an argument that extends to generalized linear models. As a corollary, association testing is also invariant to changing the reference ancestral population of the kinship matrix. Lastly, we observed that all kinship estimators, except for popkin {ROM}, can give improper non-positive semidefinite matrices, which can be problematic although some {LMMs} handle them surprisingly well, and condition numbers can be used to choose kinship estimators. Overall, we find that existing association studies are robust to kinship estimation bias, and our calculations may help improve association methods by taking advantage of this unexpected robustness, as well as help determine the effects of kinship bias in related problems.},

Advances in high-throughput genotyping technology have markedly improved our understanding of global patterns of human genetic variation and suggest the potential to use large samples to uncover variation among closely spaced populations. Here we characterize genetic variation in a sample of 3,000 European individuals genotyped at over half a million variable DNA sites in the human genome. Despite low average levels of genetic differentiation among Europeans, we find a close correspondence between genetic and geographic distances; indeed, a geographical map of Europe arises naturally as an efficient two-dimensional summary of genetic variation in Europeans. The results emphasize that when mapping the genetic basis of a disease phenotype, spurious associations can arise if genetic structure is not properly accounted for. In addition, the results are relevant to the prospects of genetic ancestry testing; an individual's DNA can be used to infer their geographic origin with surprising accuracy-often to within a few hundred kilometres.},

	abstract = {The linear mixed model (LMM) is now routinely used to estimate heritability. Unfortunately, as we demonstrate, LMM estimates of heritability can be inflated when using a standard model. To help reduce this inflation, we used a more general LMM with two random effects-one based on genomic variants and one based on easily measured spatial location as a proxy for environmental effects. We investigated this approach with simulated data and with data from a Uganda cohort of 4,778 individuals for 34 phenotypes including anthropometric indices, blood factors, glycemic control, blood pressure, lipid tests, and liver function tests. For the genomic random effect, we used identity-by-descent estimates from accurately phased genome-wide data. For the environmental random effect, we constructed a covariance matrix based on a Gaussian radial basis function. Across the simulated and Ugandan data, narrow-sense heritability estimates were lower using the more general model. Thus, our approach addresses, in part, the issue of "missing heritability" in the sense that much of the heritability previously thought to be missing was fictional.

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been established as a major tool to identify genetic variants associated with complex traits, such as common diseases. However, GWAS may suffer from false positives and false negatives due to confounding population structures, including known or unknown relatedness. Another important issue is unmeasured environmental risk factors. Among many methods for adjusting for population structures, two approaches stand out: one is principal component regression (PCR) based on principal component analysis, which is perhaps the most popular due to its early appearance, simplicity, and general effectiveness; the other is based on a linear mixed model (LMM) that has emerged recently as perhaps the most flexible and effective, especially for samples with complex structures as in model organisms. As shown previously, the PCR approach can be regarded as an approximation to an LMM; such an approximation depends on the number of the top principal components (PCs) used, the choice of which is often difficult in practice. Hence, in the presence of population structure, the LMM appears to outperform the PCR method. However, due to the different treatments of fixed vs. random effects in the two approaches, we show an advantage of PCR over LMM: in the presence of an unknown but spatially confined environmental confounder (e.g., environmental pollution or lifestyle), the PCs may be able to implicitly and effectively adjust for the confounder whereas the LMM cannot. Accordingly, to adjust for both population structures and nongenetic confounders, we propose a hybrid method combining the use and, thus, strengths of PCR and LMM. We use real genotype data and simulated phenotypes to confirm the above points, and establish the superior performance of the hybrid method across all scenarios.},

The method naturally accommodates parallel analysis of multiple phenotypes and requires only local segments of the genotype matrix to be loaded in memory, in contrast to existing alternatives, which must load genome-wide matrices into memory. This results in substantial savings in compute time and memory usage. We introduce a fast, approximate Firth logistic regression test for unbalanced case–control phenotypes. The method is ideally suited to take advantage of distributed computing frameworks.

The low transferability of results has limited our understanding of human genetic architecture across a range of complex traits. In contrast to homogeneous populations, admixed populations provide an opportunity to capture genetic architecture contributed from multiple source populations and thus improve statistical power. Here, we provide a mechanistic simulation framework to investigate the statistical power and transferability of {GWAS} under directional polygenic selection or varying divergence. We focus on a two-way admixed population and show that {GWAS} in admixed populations can be enriched for power in discovery by up to 2-fold compared to the ancestral populations under similar sample size. Moreover, higher accuracy of cross-population polygenic score estimates is also observed if variants and weights are trained in the admixed group rather than in the ancestral groups. Common variant associations are also more likely to replicate if first discovered in the admixed group and then transferred to an ancestral population, than the other way around (across 50 iterations with 1,000 causal {SNPs}, training on 10,000 individuals, testing on 1,000 in each population, p = 3.78e-6, 6.19e-101, ∼0 for {FST} = 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, respectively). While some of these {FST} values may appear extreme, we demonstrate that they are found across the entire phenome in the {GWAS} catalog. This framework demonstrates that investigation of admixed populations harbors significant advantages over {GWAS} in single-ancestry cohorts for uncovering the genetic architecture of traits and will improve downstream applications such as personalized medicine across diverse populations.},

	abstract = {Principal component analysis ({PCA}) of genetic data is routinely used to infer ancestry and control for population structure in various genetic analyses. However, conducting {PCA} analyses can be complicated and has several potential pitfalls. These pitfalls include (i) capturing linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) structure instead of population structure, (ii) projected {PCs} that suffer from shrinkage bias, (iii) detecting sample outliers and (iv) uneven population sizes. In this work, we explore these potential issues when using {PCA}, and present efficient solutions to these. Following applications to the {UK} Biobank and the 1000 Genomes project datasets, we make recommendations for best practices and provide efficient and user-friendly implementations of the proposed solutions in R packages bigsnpr and bigutilsr.For example, we find that {PC}19–{PC}40 in the {UK} Biobank capture complex {LD} structure rather than population structure. Using our automatic algorithm for removing long-range {LD} regions, we recover 16 {PCs} that capture population structure only. Therefore, we recommend using only 16–18 {PCs} from the {UK} Biobank to account for population structure confounding. We also show how to use {PCA} to restrict analyses to individuals of homogeneous ancestry. Finally, when projecting individual genotypes onto the {PCA} computed from the 1000 Genomes project data, we find a shrinkage bias that becomes large for {PC}5 and beyond. We then demonstrate how to obtain unbiased projections efficiently using bigsnpr. Overall, we believe this work would be of interest for anyone using {PCA} in their analyses of genetic data, as well as for other omics data.R packages bigsnpr and bigutilsr can be installed from either {CRAN} or {GitHub} (see https://github.com/privefl/bigsnpr).

An alternative line of research uses whole-genome random regression ({WGRR}) models that fit all markers simultaneously. Important objectives in {WGRR} studies are to estimate the proportion of variance accounted for by the markers, the effect of individual markers, prediction of genetic values for complex traits, and prediction of genetic risk of diseases. Proposals to account for stratification in this context are unsatisfactory. Here we address this problem and describe a reparameterization of a {WGRR} model, based on an eigenvalue decomposition, for simultaneous inference of parameters and unobserved population structure. This allows estimation of genomic parameters with and without inclusion of marker-derived eigenvectors that account for stratification. The method is illustrated with grain yield in wheat typed for 1279 genetic markers, and with height, {HDL} cholesterol and systolic blood pressure from the British 1958 cohort study typed for 1 million {SNP} genotypes. Both sets of data show signs of population structure but with different consequences on inferences. The method is compared to an advocated approach consisting of including eigenvectors as fixed-effect covariates in a {WGRR} model. We show that this approach, used in the context of {WGRR} models, is ill posed and illustrate the advantages of the proposed model. In summary, our method permits a unified approach to the study of population structure and inference of parameters, is computationally efficient, and is easy to implement.},

With the use of this approach, it has been estimated that over half the heritability of human height can be attributed to the {\textasciitilde}300,000 {SNPs} on a genome-wide genotyping array. In comparison, only 5\%-10\% can be explained by {SNPs} reaching genome-wide significance. We investigated via simulation the validity of several key assumptions underpinning the mixed-model analysis used in {SNP}-based h(2) estimation. Although we found that the method is reasonably robust to violations of four key assumptions, it can be highly sensitive to uneven linkage disequilibrium ({LD}) between {SNPs}: contributions to h(2) are overestimated from causal variants in regions of high {LD} and are underestimated in regions of low {LD}. The overall direction of the bias can be up or down depending on the genetic architecture of the trait, but it can be substantial in realistic scenarios. We propose a modified kinship matrix in which {SNPs} are weighted according to local {LD}. We show that this correction greatly reduces the bias and increases the precision of h(2) estimates. We demonstrate the impact of our method on the first seven diseases studied by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. Our {LD} adjustment revises downward the h(2) estimate for immune-related diseases, as expected because of high {LD} in the major-histocompatibility region, but increases it for some nonimmune diseases. To calculate our revised kinship matrix, we developed {LDAK}, software for computing {LD}-adjusted kinships.},

When these results are used to construct polygenic scores, even subtle biases can cumulatively lead to large errors. To study the effect of residual stratification, we simulated {GWAS} under realistic models of demographic history. We show that when population structure is recent, it cannot be corrected using principal components of common variants because they are uninformative about recent history. Consequently, polygenic scores are biased in that they recapitulate environmental structure. Principal components calculated from rare variants or identity-by-descent segments can correct this stratification for some types of environmental effects. While family-based studies are immune to stratification, the hybrid approach of ascertaining variants in {GWAS} but reestimating effect sizes in siblings reduces but does not eliminate stratification. We show that the effect of population stratification depends not only on allele frequencies and environmental structure but also on demographic history.},

Appropriate methods for controlling genetic relationships among individuals need to balance the concern of false positives and statistical power, which can vary for different association sample types. We used a series of simulated samples and empirical data sets from cross- and self-pollinated species to demonstrate the performance of several contemporary methods in correcting for different types of genetic relationships encountered in association analysis. We proposed a two-stage dimension determination approach for both principal component analysis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling ({nMDS}) to capture the major structure pattern in association mapping samples. Our results showed that by exploiting both genotypic and phenotypic information, this two-stage dimension determination approach balances the trade-off between data fit and model complexity, resulting in an effective reduction in false positive rate with minimum loss in statistical power. Further, the {nMDS} technique of correcting for genetic relationship proved to be a powerful complement to other existing methods. Our findings highlight the significance of appropriate application of different statistical methods for dealing with complex genetic relationships in various genomewide association studies.},

	abstract = {Genomic mapping of complex traits across species demands integrating genetics and statistics. In particular, because it is easily interpreted, the R2 statistic is commonly used in quantitative trait locus ({QTL}) mapping studies to measure the proportion of phenotypic variation explained by molecular markers. Mixed models with random polygenic effects have been used in complex trait dissection in different species. However, unlike fixed linear regression models, linear mixed models have no well-established R2 statistic for assessing goodness-of-fit and prediction power. Our objectives were to assess the performance of several R2-like statistics for a linear mixed model in association mapping and to identify any such statistic that measures model-data agreement and provides an intuitive indication of {QTL} effect. Our results showed that the likelihood-ratio-based R2 ({RLR}2) satisfies several critical requirements proposed for the R2-like statistic. As {RLR}2 reduces to the regular R2 for fixed models without random effects other than residual, it provides a general measure for the effect of {QTL} in mixed-model association mapping. Moreover, we found that {RLR}2 can help explain the overlap between overall population structure modeled as fixed effects and relative kinship modeled though random effects. As both approaches are derived from molecular marker information and are not mutually exclusive, comparing {RLR}2 values from different models provides a logical bridge between statistical analysis and underlying genetics of complex traits.},

In practice, the needed number of components or factors is often determined by the size of the first few eigenvalues of the sample covariance/correlation matrix. Lawley (1956) showed that if eigenvalues of population covariance matrix are distinct, then each sample eigenvalue contains a bias of order 1/N, which is typically ignored in practice. This article further shows that, under some regulatory conditions, the order of the bias term is p/N. Thus, when p is large, the bias term is no longer negligible even when N is large.},

Here, we characterized and controlled for this diversity in genome-wide association studies ({GWASs}) for the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos ({HCHS}/{SOL}). We simultaneously estimated population-structure principal components ({PCs}) robust to familial relatedness and pairwise kinship coefficients ({KCs}) robust to population structure, admixture, and Hardy-Weinberg departures. The {PCs} revealed substantial genetic differentiation within and among six self-identified background groups (Cuban, Dominican, Puerto Rican, Mexican, and Central and South American). To control for variation among groups, we developed a multi-dimensional clustering method to define a “genetic-analysis group” variable that retains many properties of self-identified background while achieving substantially greater genetic homogeneity within groups and including participants with non-specific self-identification. In {GWASs} of 22 biomedical traits, we used a linear mixed model ({LMM}) including pairwise empirical {KCs} to account for familial relatedness, {PCs} for ancestry, and genetic-analysis groups for additional group-associated effects. Including the genetic-analysis group as a covariate accounted for significant trait variation in 8 of 22 traits, even after we fit 20 {PCs}. Additionally, genetic-analysis groups had significant heterogeneity of residual variance for 20 of 22 traits, and modeling this heteroscedasticity within the {LMM} reduced genomic inflation for 19 traits. Furthermore, fitting an {LMM} that utilized a genetic-analysis group rather than a self-identified background group achieved higher power to detect previously reported associations. We expect that the methods applied here will be useful in other studies with multiple ethnic groups, admixture, and relatedness.},

As medical genomics studies become increasingly large and diverse, gaining insights into population history and consequently the transferability of disease risk measurement is critical. Here, we disentangle recent population history in the widely used 1000 Genomes Project reference panel, with an emphasis on populations underrepresented in medical studies. To examine the transferability of single-ancestry {GWASs}, we used published summary statistics to calculate polygenic risk scores for eight well-studied phenotypes. We identify directional inconsistencies in all scores; for example, height is predicted to decrease with genetic distance from Europeans, despite robust anthropological evidence that West Africans are as tall as Europeans on average. To gain deeper quantitative insights into {GWAS} transferability, we developed a complex trait coalescent-based simulation framework considering effects of polygenicity, causal allele frequency divergence, and heritability. As expected, correlations between true and inferred risk are typically highest in the population from which summary statistics were derived. We demonstrate that scores inferred from European {GWASs} are biased by genetic drift in other populations even when choosing the same causal variants and that biases in any direction are possible and unpredictable. This work cautions that summarizing findings from large-scale {GWASs} may have limited portability to other populations using standard approaches and highlights the need for generalized risk prediction methods and the inclusion of more diverse individuals in medical genomics.},

Approximately 15 genes have been directly associated with skin pigmentation variation in humans, leading to its characterization as a relatively simple trait. However, by assembling a global survey of quantitative skin pigmentation phenotypes, we demonstrate that pigmentation is more complex than previously assumed, with genetic architecture varying by latitude. We investigate polygenicity in the {KhoeSan} populations indigenous to southern Africa who have considerably lighter skin than equatorial Africans. We demonstrate that skin pigmentation is highly heritable, but known pigmentation loci explain only a small fraction of the variance. Rather, baseline skin pigmentation is a complex, polygenic trait in the {KhoeSan}. Despite this, we identify canonical and non-canonical skin pigmentation loci, including near {SLC}24A5, {TYRP}1, {SMARCA}2/{VLDLR}, and {SNX}13, using a genome-wide association approach complemented by targeted resequencing. By considering diverse, under-studied African populations, we show how the architecture of skin pigmentation can vary across humans subject to different local evolutionary pressures.},

These studies have not included individuals with ancestry from the American continents (Amerindian ancestry), such as Hispanics/Latinos. In an analysis of {RBC} traits in up to 19,608 Hispanics/Latinos, we identified an Amerindian-ancestry genetic association in a known alpha-globin regulatory region. We also identified three new {RBC} trait associations, including a regulatory variant of {SLC}12A2 that encodes a {RBC} membrane ion-transport protein. Experimental disruption of this regulatory element led to reduced expression of both {SLC}12A2 and an adjacent long non-coding {RNA} in human erythroid progenitor cells.

However, the impact, interplay, and underlying biological mechanisms among {BMI}, environment, genetics, and ancestry are not completely understood. To further examine these relationships, we utilized 427,509 calendar year-averaged {BMI} measurements from 100,418 adults from the single large multiethnic Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging ({GERA}) cohort. We observed substantial independent ancestry and nationality differences, including ancestry principal component interactions and nonlinear effects. To increase the list of {BMI}-associated variants before assessing other differences, we conducted a genome-wide association study ({GWAS}) in {GERA}, with replication in the Genetic Investigation of Anthropomorphic Traits ({GIANT}) consortium combined with the {UK} Biobank ({UKB}), followed by {GWAS} in {GERA} combined with {GIANT}, with replication in the {UKB}. We discovered 30 novel independent {BMI} loci (P {\textless} 5.0 × 10−8) that replicated. We then assessed the proportion of {BMI} variance explained by sex in the {UKB} using previously identified loci compared to previously and newly identified loci and found slight increases: from 3.0 to 3.3\% for males and from 2.7 to 3.0\% for females. Further, the variance explained by previously and newly identified variants decreased with increasing age in the {GERA} and {UKB} cohorts, echoed in the variance explained by the entire genome, which also showed gene–age interaction effects. Finally, we conducted a tissue expression {QTL} enrichment analysis, which revealed that {GWAS} {BMI}-associated variants were enriched in the cerebellum, consistent with prior work in humans and mice.},

	abstract = {For many complex traits, gene regulation is likely to play a crucial mechanistic role. How the genetic architectures of complex traits vary between populations and subsequent effects on genetic prediction are not well understood, in part due to the historical paucity of {GWAS} in populations of non-European ancestry. We used data from the {MESA} (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) cohort to characterize the genetic architecture of gene expression within and between diverse populations. Genotype and monocyte gene expression were available in individuals with African American ({AFA}, n = 233), Hispanic ({HIS}, n = 352), and European ({CAU}, n = 578) ancestry. We performed expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTL}) mapping in each population and show genetic correlation of gene expression depends on shared ancestry proportions. Using elastic net modeling with cross validation to optimize genotypic predictors of gene expression in each population, we show the genetic architecture of gene expression for most predictable genes is sparse. We found the best predicted gene in each population, {TACSTD}2 in {AFA} and {CHURC}1 in {CAU} and {HIS}, had similar prediction performance across populations with R2 {\textgreater} 0.8 in each population. However, we identified a subset of genes that are well-predicted in one population, but poorly predicted in another. We show these differences in predictive performance are due to allele frequency differences between populations. Using genotype weights trained in {MESA} to predict gene expression in independent populations showed that a training set with ancestry similar to the test set is better at predicting gene expression in test populations, demonstrating an urgent need for diverse population sampling in genomics. Our predictive models and performance statistics in diverse cohorts are made publicly available for use in transcriptome mapping methods at https://github.com/{WheelerLab}/{DivPop}.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) have laid the foundation for investigations into the biology of complex traits, drug development and clinical guidelines. However, the majority of discovery efforts are based on data from populations of European ancestry1-3. In light of the differential genetic architecture that is known to exist between populations, bias in representation can exacerbate existing disease and healthcare disparities. Critical variants may be missed if they have a low frequency or are completely absent in European populations, especially as the field shifts its attention towards rare variants, which are more likely to be population-specific4-10. Additionally, effect sizes and their derived risk prediction scores derived in one population may not accurately extrapolate to other populations11,12. Here we demonstrate the value of diverse, multi-ethnic participants in large-scale genomic studies. The Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology ({PAGE}) study conducted a {GWAS} of 26 clinical and behavioural phenotypes in 49,839 non-European individuals. Using strategies tailored for analysis of multi-ethnic and admixed populations, we describe a framework for analysing diverse populations, identify 27 novel loci and 38 secondary signals at known loci, as well as replicate 1,444 {GWAS} catalogue associations across these traits. Our data show evidence of effect-size heterogeneity across ancestries for published {GWAS} associations, substantial benefits for fine-mapping using diverse cohorts and insights into clinical implications. In the United States-where minority populations have a disproportionately higher burden of chronic conditions13-the lack of representation of diverse populations in genetic research will result in inequitable access to precision medicine for those with the highest burden of disease. We strongly advocate for continued, large genome-wide efforts in diverse populations to maximize genetic discovery and reduce health disparities.},

However, the methodological impact of the use of local ancestry on high-dimensional omics analyses, including, most prominently, expression quantitative trait loci ({eQTL}) mapping and trait heritability estimation, in admixed populations remains critically underexplored. Here, we develop a statistical framework that characterizes the relationships among the determinants of the genetic architecture of an important class of molecular traits. We provide a computationally efficient approach to local ancestry analysis in {eQTL} mapping while increasing control of type I and type {II} error over traditional approaches. Applying our method to National Institute of General Medical Sciences ({NIGMS}) and Genotype-Tissue Expression ({GTEx}) datasets, we show that the use of local ancestry can improve {eQTL} mapping in admixed and multiethnic populations, respectively. We estimate the trait variance explained by ancestry by using local admixture relatedness between individuals. By using simulations of diverse genetic architectures and degrees of confounding, we show improved accuracy in estimating heritability when accounting for local ancestry similarity. Furthermore, we characterize the sparse versus polygenic components of gene expression in admixed individuals. Our study has important methodological implications for genetic analysis of omics traits across a range of genomic contexts, from a single variant to a prioritized region to the entire genome. Our findings highlight the importance of using local ancestry to better characterize the heritability of complex traits and to more accurately map genetic associations.},

Although hundreds of associated loci have been identified through genetic association studies, the contribution of genetic factors to variation in lipids is not fully understood, particularly in U.S. minority groups. We performed genome-wide association analyses for four lipid traits in over 45,000 ancestrally diverse participants from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology ({PAGE}) Study, followed by a meta-analysis with several European ancestry studies. We identified nine novel lipid loci, five of which showed evidence of replication in independent studies. Furthermore, we discovered one novel gene in a {PrediXcan} analysis, minority-specific independent signals at eight previously reported loci, and potential functional variants at two known loci through fine-mapping. Systematic examination of known lipid loci revealed smaller effect estimates in African American and Hispanic ancestry populations than those in Europeans, and better performance of polygenic risk scores based on minority-specific effect estimates. Our findings provide new insight into the genetic architecture of lipid traits and highlight the importance of conducting genetic studies in diverse populations in the era of precision medicine.},

Although the great majority of these studies have been performed in European-descent individuals, it has been recognised that including populations with differing ancestries enhances the potential for identifying causal {SNPs} due to their differing patterns of linkage disequilibrium. However, when individuals from distinct ethnicities are included in a {GWAS}, it is necessary to implement a number of control steps to ensure that the identified associations are real genotype-phenotype relationships. In this Review, we discuss the analyses that are required when performing multi-ethnic studies, including methods for determining ancestry at the global and local level for sample exclusion, controlling for ancestry in association testing, and post-{GWAS} interrogation methods such as genomic control and meta-analysis. We hope that this overview provides a primer for those researchers interested in including distinct populations in their studies.},

Multi-ancestry {GWAS} meta-analysis identified 237 loci attaining stringent genome-wide significance (P {\textless} 5 × 10-9), which were delineated to 338 distinct association signals. Fine-mapping of these signals was enhanced by the increased sample size and expanded population diversity of the multi-ancestry meta-analysis, which localized 54.4\% of T2D associations to a single variant with {\textgreater}50\% posterior probability. This improved fine-mapping enabled systematic assessment of candidate causal genes and molecular mechanisms through which T2D associations are mediated, laying the foundations for functional investigations. Multi-ancestry genetic risk scores enhanced transferability of T2D prediction across diverse populations.

	abstract = {Individuals of admixed ancestries (for example, African Americans) inherit a mosaic of ancestry segments (local ancestry) originating from multiple continental ancestral populations. This offers the unique opportunity of investigating the similarity of genetic effects on traits across ancestries within the same population. Here we introduce an approach to estimate correlation of causal genetic effects (radmix) across local ancestries and analyze 38 complex traits in African-European admixed individuals (N = 53,001) to observe very high correlations (meta-analysis radmix = 0.95, 95\% credible interval 0.93–0.97), much higher than correlation of causal effects across continental ancestries. We replicate our results using regression-based methods from marginal genome-wide association study summary statistics. We also report realistic scenarios where regression-based methods yield inflated heterogeneity-by-ancestry due to ancestry-specific tagging of causal effects, and/or polygenicity. Our results motivate genetic analyses that assume minimal heterogeneity in causal effects by ancestry, with implications for the inclusion of ancestry-diverse individuals in studies.},
